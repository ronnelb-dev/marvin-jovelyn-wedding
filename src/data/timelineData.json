After a year in Bulacan, she returned to STI, where her old friends had made new ones—including Ronnel. They started hanging out in groups and shared occasional jokes, but never really talked one-on-one. On July 18, 2016, Ronnel was invited to one of Junna’s best friend’s surprise birthday party. That’s when he added her on Facebook… but they never chatted (yet!). 😄",

But honestly, Ronnel couldn’t think of a real tease—because Junna always confidently said, “I’m beautiful!” 😄 During this time, Ronnel quietly began to see something more in Junna. She was simple, down-to-earth, and knew how to manage things at home. He started thinking… she’s wife material That playful friendship was the beginning of something special.",

She would always invite Ronnel to join her, and they'd place playful bets on who would be chosen—and whether that person could actually sing or not. Come Tuesday, they'd relive those moments in the office, laughing about who guessed right and who got it hilariously wrong.",
